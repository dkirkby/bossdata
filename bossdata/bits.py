"""Define bit masks used in BOSS data and support symbolic operations on masks.

The SDSS bitmasks are documented at http://www.sdss3.org/dr10/algorithms/bitmasks.php.

    """Define a new type for a bitmask with specified symbolic bit names.

    After defining a bitmask type, its bit names are accessible as class-level
    attributes of the returned type and can be used as integer values, for example::

        >>> COLORS = define_bitmask('COLORS','Primary Colors',RED=0,BLUE=1,GREEN=4)

    The :func:`decode_bitmask` function is useful for converting an integral value back
    to a list of symbolic bit names.

    Args:
        mask_name(str): The type name for this mask. By convention, this name is upper
            case and matches the name assigned to this function's return value, as
            in the examples above.
        mask_description(str): A description of this bit mask that will be available as
            the docstring of the new defined type.
        bits(dict): A dictionary of name,definition pairs that define the mapping from
            symbolic bit names to bit offsets and optional comments. Although
            this argument can be passed as a dictionary, the dictionary is usually
            implicitly defined by the argument list, as in the examples above.
            By convention, bit names are all upper case. Each bit definition can either
            be specified as an integer offset >= 0 or else an (offset,description) tuple.

    Returns:
        type: A new type with the specified name that has class-level attributes for
